This directory contains two of the official examples (counter and todomvc)
rewritten from ES6 to CoffeeScript. JSX part is also rewritten
using the [r-dom](https://github.com/uber/r-dom) library.

Furthermore it contains a small React only examples (without Redux).

All examples in the subdirectory contains a README.md with some exercises.

Use this shell script to run `npm install` for every example:

```
cd examples-coffee
./install-all.sh
```

To start webpack (which bundle the files for the browser with watch mode) go
into an example directory and run `npm start`.
